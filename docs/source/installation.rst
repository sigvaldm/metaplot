Installation
------------

To install Metaplot from PyPI::

    pip install metaplot

Since Metaplot is in a very early development phase, you may want to install it in directly from a GitHub clone, such that when new bugfixes appear, you can pull them from GitHub with immediate effect. If that's the case you should rather install Metaplot like this::

    git clone https://github.com/sigvaldm/metaplot.git
    cd metaplot
    pip install -e .

To get the latest changes you can now run ``git pull`` on the following folder. Bugfixes may take a considerably longer time to appear on PyPI.
