Installation
------------

To install the latest stable version of Metaplot from PyPI::

    $ pip install metaplot

However, Metaplot is in a very experimental trial-and-error stage. It may be necessary to run the latest *development* version, i.e., the latest Git commit,  despite any stability issues. To install the latest development version::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sigvaldm/metaplot.git
    $ cd metaplot
    $ pip install -e .

Thanks to the ``-e`` flag, any changes made in the ``metaplot`` folder has immediate effect. To change version of ``metaplot``, simply check out the version you need, e.g., ``git pull`` to get the most recent one.
